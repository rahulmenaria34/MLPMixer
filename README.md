TO run the code and contribution 
just need to run the jupyternotebook file in google collab as it is partially linux based ( which works well on google collab).
Steps to follow
1. Download the ipynb
2. Upload on google collab
3. Download the Testing_images folder.
4. Run the code till got clone.
5. Put the image folder under /gdrive/MyDrive/vision_transformer_colab/vision_transformer/Testing_images where "vision_transformer_colab" is the path of the folder which is automatically git cloned by running the above code.
6. Run the collab from starting to end.
7. At last it will take images from the Testing_images folder and then will iterate through each image, apply model on that and give the corresponding output.
